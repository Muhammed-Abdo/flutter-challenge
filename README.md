# Flutter Orders Analytics Dashboard

A Flutter application that provides analytics and visualization for orders data using a clean MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with BLoC pattern.

## Features

- **Home Dashboard**: Central navigation hub with easy access to our 2 main pages(Metrics, Graph)
- **Detailed Metrics**: 
  - Total orders count
  - Average order price
  - Number of returned orders
  - All-time order statistics
- **Order Trends Graph**: 
  - Interactive line chart with area fill
  - Monthly order volume visualization
  - Clear axis labels and grid lines

## Project Structure

The project follows MVVM  architecture pattern  while using BloC as our View-model

### Architecture Components


- **App**: all common utilities shared across the app
- **Data**: response classes and business logic
- **Domain**: model classes and repository
- **Presentation**: folds:
	- **View**: UI components (pages and widgets)
	- **ViewModel**: BLoC/Cubit classes managing state and business logic
	- 
## Dependencies

### Key Dependencies

- `flutter_bloc`: State management using BLoC pattern
- `fl_chart`: Chart visualization library
- `get_it`: Dependency injection
- `json_serializable`: JSON serialization
- `Json_annotation`: to use JSON serializable annotation
- `build_runner`: to generate autogenerated files (used here in json serialization)
- `equatable`: Value equality for state managment
- `intl`: Internationalization and formatting
- `collection`: Additional collection methods(e.g. Group by)

## How to run the app

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Generate JSON serialization code:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## State Management

The app uses the BLoC pattern through `flutter_bloc` for state management:

- `OrdersCubit`: Manages order data and states
- States include: loading, loaded, and failure states
- Provides both  metrics and graph with  data for visualization

## UI Components

### HomePage
- Main navigation hub
- Two main sections:
  - Metrics dashboard access
  - Order graph visualization access

### MetricsPage
- Displays key performance indicators
- Card-based layout for metrics
- Real-time calculations for averages and totals

### GraphPage
- Interactive line chart showing order trends
- Monthly data grouping
- Customizable grid and axes

## Error Handling

- Loading states with progress indicators
- Error states with user-friendly messages
- Empty state handling

## Styling

- Consistent text styling with bold headers
- Material Design icons
- Responsive layout
- Color-coded indicators
- Elevation and borders for card components

## Assets

The application includes:
- `assets/api/data/orders.json`: Sample orders data acts as mock api 

## Future Improvements
- the project is ready to be modified to communicate with remote data sources 
- the project is ready to introduce new features 
- upcoming implementations would be navigation, theming, responsive ui, localization, 

## Minimum Requirements

- Flutter SDK: ^3.5.3
- Dart SDK: ^3.5.3
